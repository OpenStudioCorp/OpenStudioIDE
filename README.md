# OpenStudioIDE
welcome to the repository dedicated to the built in house IDE for OpenStudio!

this IDE is used by some or even most of our members to make and compile c# code and scripts

this is also being used to compile programs with ironpython

----------------
currently Visual studio 22 and earlier is still being used to develop this program 
and because of that it wont be great from the start.

over time we hope to make the IDE inside of itself to seperate from the visual studio parts.
